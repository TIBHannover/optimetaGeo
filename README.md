# OPTIMETA Geoplugin

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The OPTIMETA geo plugin offers a novel way to capture and provide geospatial properties of research articles in [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) (OJS).
It is developed as part of the BMBF-funded project [OPTIMETA](https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta/en/).
A first prototype was developed under the name *geoOJS* by Tom Niers for the BSc. thesis [Geospatial Metadata for Discovery in Scholarly Publishing](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:6-69029469735); the work was [presented at The Munin Conference on Scholarly Publishing, 2020](https://doi.org/10.7557/5.5590), see [recording](https://youtu.be/-Lc9AjHq_AY).

Authors can either search for a location and accept the suggested bounding box or manually create one or more suitable geometric shape(s) on a map.
If authors enter geometries, a gazetteer is used to suggest a matching administrative unit’s name to the author.
This allows the plugin to store geospatial data in two forms: as text, using an administrative unit or standardised geographical norm data, and as geospatial coordinates in GeoJSON format.
Thereby the coordinates are stored accurately, while at the same time a textual description is accessible and flexible for non-map-related usage.
In addition to displaying geospatial information on maps, it is also added to the HTML source code of article’s landing pages in a semantically meaningful way.
In the article view, the properties specified by the author are then displayed and available for download as geoJSON.

# Download & Installation

## Release

See releases at <>.
The release bundles contain only the required JavaScript dependencies.

## From source

1. Checkout the desired version from [the code repository](https://github.com/TIBHannover/optimetaGeo/) and save the contents into `ojs/plugins/generic/optimetaGeo` in your OJS installation
1. Run `composer install` to download JavaScript dependencies for the plugin using [Asset Packagist](https://asset-packagist.org/site/about)
   Go to `js/lib/leaflet-control-geocoder` and run `npm install` (see [this issue](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder/issues/310))
1. Activate the plugin in the OJS plug-in settings
1. Install and activate the OJS Geoplugin Theme: <https://github.com/ifgi/optimetaGeoTheme/releases>

# Configuration

1. Configure **GeoNames**

   You have to specify your username for the GeoNames api, so that an alignment for the administrative units is possible.

   1. Create an account on <https://www.geonames.org/login>
   1. Enter the username in the settings (OJS > Settings > Website > Plugins > Installed Plugins > OPTIMETA geo plugin > blue arrow > Settings)
1. Configure **theme**

   Set the name of your used theme.

Further information is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/tnier01/geoOJS/wiki).

# Contribute

All help is welcome: asking questions, providing documentation, testing, or even development.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md).

# Notes about accuracy

- accuracy +/- 2 m (via https://twitter.com/nyalldawson/status/1393050257554956289?s=09) is sufficient for discovery

# Testing

Tests are run with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), for which dependencies are installed with npm using the `package.json`.

## Running Cypress locally

```bash
# see also Cypress' system dependencies at https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Advanced-Installation
npm install

npx cypress open

# start compose configuration for desired OJS version, running on port 8080; OJS_VERSION is a image tag for pkpofficial/ojs
export OJS_VERSION=3_3_0-11 &&     docker-compose --file cypress/docker-compose-mysql.yml down --volume && docker-compose --file cypress/docker-compose-mysql.yml up
export OJS_VERSION=3_2_1-4 && docker-compose --file cypress/docker-compose-mysql.yml down --volume && docker-compose --file cypress/docker-compose-mysql.yml up

# open/run Cypress tests with a given OJS version
npm run cy_open
npm run cy_run
```

To debug, add `debugger;` to the code and make sure to have the developer tools open in the browser windows started by Cypress.

## Writing tests

1. Start docker-compose configuration (see above)
1. Start Cypress (see above)
1. Write tests, run them in Cypress
1. If you need a clean start (= empty database) for a test, stop the docker-compose configuration, delete it ('down --volume') and restart it
